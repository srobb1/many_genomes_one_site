These extraordinary creatures have evolved the unique ability to fly, with sizes ranging from the tiny 2-gram bumblebee bat, which has a wingspan of just 6 inches, to the impressive flying foxes, weighing up to 1.6 kilograms and spanning up to 5 feet 7 inches. This vast diversity in size, along with other fascinating phenotypic traits such as echolocation and specialized dietary habits, makes bats a compelling subject of study.",

These contributions not only support the natural world but also benefit humanity by enhancing agricultural productivity and reducing the need for pesticides. Beyond their ecological importance, bats hold significant cultural value worldwide. In many Eastern cultures, bats are revered as symbols of good fortune, happiness, and longevity, while in the West, they are often associated with mystery and the supernatural. Understanding these diverse cultural perspectives enriches our appreciation of bats and underscores their multifaceted significance.",

Their walls and the septa are indistinct. The skeleton is porous and there are small smooth surface projections known as verrucae which give the coral its common name of rice coral. These are irregularly spaced and may be fused near the tips of branches. The colour is normally pale brown with white verrucae.
